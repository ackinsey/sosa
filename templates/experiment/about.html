	<h1>ABOUT SOSA</h1>
	<p>
	Approaches to psychological assessment may be broadly classified as either objective or projective.  Objective tests use a restricted format to constrain responses of participants, and rely on comparison of individual responses to population norms for interpretation (e.g. MMPI); projective (or free response) tests allow participants to respond freely to stimuli (e.g. Rorschach Ink Blot).  SOSA (Simultaneous Objective and Subjective Assessment) is an approach to psychological assessment that combines elements of both of objective and projective approaches.  SOSA allows experimenters to collect objective data that describe the subjective schemas individuals hold about the relationships they perceive among ‘stimuli’.  Unlike standard projective tests the SOSA approach does not rely on use of (is not specific to) any particular type of stimuli, stimuli could consist of any objects, events, concepts, etc.  Participants are instructed to arrange the stimuli in space until the pattern of distances among stimuli best represents the relationships that they perceive among them (free response).  The specific patterns participants generate to describe their schemas, the series of stimulus placements used to generate their schemas (with a timeline), and the distances between each specific stimulus in the final schema provide objective data for analysis.  The SOSA approach provides more accurate assessment than typical objective tests, however, because participants’ responses are not constrained by scale values.  The SOSA program also eliminates experimenter errors in data entry since it allows experimenters to present stimuli and generate data electronically.  Because of the flexibility SOSA allows in stimulus presentation, and due to the range of data generated, SOSA is open to application in a wide variety of settings.

	Two examples of completed projects may better demonstrate how SOSA may be applied.  The first example is a study on ‘Religious Perception’ in which participants arranged figures representing individuals of different religions in relation to a figure representing themselves to demonstrate how ‘close’ they felt to each religion.  The patterns and distances generated, along with psychological tests, provided some insight into factors related to religious prejudice.  Another example is a study on emotional assessment in which individuals completed psychological tests (personality: NEO, and emotions: PANSA-X and EDI) and arranged pegs representing clinically relevant emotions (5 negative and 5 positive) relative to a figure representing themselves to demonstrate their typical emotional state.  Participants generated unique sets of emotion predictors (based on emotion peg distances from self) for NEO facets and domains.
